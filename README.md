## This repository

This repository is a collection of projects i will use to learn various programming languages. Why? Because i want to.

## The code

I want a standardized project to do in all langs, but for now i don't have one. I plan to do a Parser Generator than creates a parser to the language it was written in, but that's requires a lot of theory, so i need time to study and experiment.

## What I've done so far

- **D lang**: A simple LALR Parser for a arithmetic grammar. More details you can find inside the README in the d_lang folder.
